## Day Summary

**Key Points**
- We gapped down after gapping up yesterday (although in balance).  
- We put in a tight IB and looked like we would get a trend day up. The problem is that we have FOMC tomorrow and my bias led me to believe that it was improbable to get a trend day before FOMC (at least when I don't suspect a change in the narrative).
