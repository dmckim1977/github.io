AfterMarket Report - March 20 2024

Market Overview

After a bullish reaction to the FOMC announcement, the market has entered uncharted territory, prompting a focus on monitoring for acceptance at higher prices and continuation of the current trend.

Previous Day Review

The session began with a sideways overnight market and an open inside the overnight and previous day's range, indicating a weak opening leading up to the FOMC event. Trading remained within a balanced range until the announcement, which saw buyers stepping in to lift the market to new record highs.

Following the first breakout from balance, there was a liquidation of weak longs back to the most accepted price before the market extended its range higher. The session concluded with a close near the day's highs, leaving unfilled singles below.

Analysis

While the move higher was characterized by a bullish sentiment, the market's structure was noted as weak, with light volume accompanying the break from balance. This suggests a potential lack of strong conviction behind the rally, warranting caution and careful monitoring for sustained acceptance at these elevated prices.

Strategy Going Forward

Given the uncharted territory and the nuances observed in the market's structure and volume, it's essential to maintain a vigilant approach. Monitoring for signs of genuine acceptance at higher prices, accompanied by robust volume and follow-through, will be crucial for assessing the sustainability of the current bullish trend.


### Turning to ES

We had a muted overnight session at 13.25 points and 180k traded at the previous days highs. We were able to get the pHOD in the overnight session as well.  

We opened up neutral and traded sideways until the FOMC announcemnt. After the announcement and Powell's presser, we saw the usual volatility and the market broke higher into fresh record high territory.

##### Session Stats

- We had overlapping to higher value...  
- One set of singles (they were not filled).  
- 1.1 mln traded, 56.50 points of range, +3k delta
- Trend Day up  

We are back above balance in uncharted territory with little market overhang in the near term. I take the perspective that after a major release like this the market begins a new auction so my job is to monitor the auction for signs of continuation. I will let price advertise and focus on references to see where the bid and ask are at. 

# Weekly Review Sunday March 17th 2024

Signs of buyer exhaustion as we traded inside the previous weeks range. Next week we look to continue the one timeframing up (on the weekly and monthly timeframe) or do we continue the daily march lower?

I want to start off by saying that I have been struggling to stay disciplined and focused lately. This is due to several factors but of course I am the only one to blame. There simply isn't even time in the day to do everything I want to do and even if there was I don't have limitless energy, focus, and motivation to do it anyway. I have spent a lot of time this morning thinking about the previous few months. What have I done well, what I have not done well, also what I stopped doing that I need to resume and **most importantly** what am I missing? Its easy to say I need to start running again but the difficult part is discovering what I am not doing that I should be doing. It's exactly the same thing as looking at _what the market has **not** done_. Sometimes that information is the most valuable information we have. I have several sayings that I keep close to heart. One is 'I can see only because I stand on the shoulders of giants'. This is attributed to Newton but I think was originally said by a french philosopher at a Cathedral. Thats not important but my other saying is 'There must be a better way'. These are the words I live by every day. I don't ever seem to care how well something works, there must be a better way. Sometimes that means I don't give up until I find a better way and sometimes that just means something is good enough and then I focus my efforts elsewhere. 

Trading is a very solitary endeavor. Most of us do this alone. We are only accountable to ourselves. There are some major downsides for example we don't have anyone to pick us up and dust us off after a bad day or a bad week. We don't have someone to tap us on the shoulder to tell us when we should walk away. We also don't have anyone to high five us or congratulate us if we have a good week or a good month. Trading is an individual sport like Golf or Chess but that doesn't mean we have to do it all alone.

When we do join trading groups those groups are more often a business venture of the person that created that group and charges a fee or a loosely organized community group of traders that is more of a community as opposed to a place to grow. I don't have any problem with someone creating a trading group to profit from his expertise but that often isn't a place where most people can become better traders. There are a lot of great traders publically accessible on X and Youtube but there aren't many great traders that are also great teachers and leaders.

Trading professionally is not even close to being as easy as we all thought it was in the beginning but nothing makes it impossible. I don't think that everyone can be a profitable trader but all of the traits to become profitable are available to everyone. 

I am almost done with my rant here but the point of this is that I have been working on many different ways to improve my trading. I have created several tools that truly have edge. I have developed processes for helping understand market context, forecast probabilities, ways to identify issues and ways to solve them. I have a lot more stuff I am currently working on too but the one thing that has been difficult to figure out is how to find other people that are willing to work at this as hard as I do. I know they are out there but I have no idea how to find them. My goal is to be a part of that elite group of individuals that not only want to get to the World Series but want to win it every year. My point is if anyone sees this video and is interested in being a part of that, reach out to me. If you just enjoy the content, that is fine too.

- After the close I review the market and get ready for the next day.
