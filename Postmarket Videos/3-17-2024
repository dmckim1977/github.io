# Weekly Review Sunday March 17th 2024

Signs of buyer exhaustion as we traded inside the previous weeks range. Next week we look to continue the one timeframing up (on the weekly and monthly timeframe) or do we continue the daily march lower?

---

I want to start off by saying that I have been struggling to stay disciplined and focused lately. This is due to several factors but of course I am the only one to blame. There simply isn't even time in the day to do everything I want to do and even if there was I don't have limitless energy, focus, and motivation to do it anyway. I have spent a lot of time this morning thinking about the previous few months. What have I done well, what I have not done well, also what I stopped doing that I need to resume and **most importantly** what am I missing? Its easy to say I need to start running again but the difficult part is discovering what I am not doing that I should be doing. It's exactly the same thing as looking at _what the market has **not** done_. Sometimes that information is the most valuable information we have. I have several sayings that I keep close to heart. One is 'I can see only because I stand on the shoulders of giants'. This is attributed to Newton but I think was originally said by a french philosopher at a Cathedral. Thats not important but my other saying is 'There must be a better way'. These are the words I live by every day. I don't ever seem to care how well something works, there must be a better way. Sometimes that means I don't give up until I find a better way and sometimes that just means something is good enough and then I focus my efforts elsewhere. 

Trading is a very solitary endeavor. Most of us do this alone. We are only accountable to ourselves. There are some major downsides for example we don't have anyone to pick us up and dust us off after a bad day or a bad week. We don't have someone to tap us on the shoulder to tell us when we should walk away. We also don't have anyone to high five us or congratulate us if we have a good week or a good month. Trading is an individual sport like Golf or Chess but that doesn't mean we have to do it all alone.

When we do join trading groups those groups are more often a business venture of the person that created that group and charges a fee or a loosely organized community group of traders that is more of a community as opposed to a place to grow. I don't have any problem with someone creating a trading group to profit from his expertise but that often isn't a place where most people can become better traders. There are a lot of great traders publically accessible on X and Youtube but there aren't many great traders that are also great teachers and leaders.

Trading professionally is not even close to being as easy as we all thought it was in the beginning but nothing makes it impossible. I don't think that everyone can be a profitable trader but all of the traits to become profitable are available to everyone. 

I am almost done with my rant here but the point of this is that I have been working on many different ways to improve my trading. I have created several tools that truly have edge. I have developed processes for helping understand market context, forecast probabilities, ways to identify issues and ways to solve them. I have a lot more stuff I am currently working on too but the one thing that has been difficult to figure out is how to find other people that are willing to work at this as hard as I do. I know they are out there but I have no idea how to find them. My goal is to be a part of that elite group of individuals that not only want to get to the World Series but want to win it every year. My point is if anyone sees this video and is interested in being a part of that, reach out to me. If you just enjoy the content, that is fine too.

### This is my workflow

- Each morning I spend at least an hour reviewing the previous day and overnight.  
- During the day I track market generated information.  
- After the close I review the market and get ready for the next day.
