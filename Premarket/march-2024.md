## Previous Day Review

Tuesday was a good example of how the price action inside of balance can be hard to forecast with high probability. After a large gap up on Monday we had a large move of -29 points in the overnight that ended with a 10 point gap at the open. The majority of the move was late in the Euro session. 

I wrote in my premarket note that when the market stops making sense (to me) I get more cautious. I also said that I will look for continuation down but I want to see clear MGI showing the probabilities for continuation down are strong. 

We opened and immediately saw weakness off the open but couldn't get much follow through selling. B period then put in an inside bar leaving a small IB of only 11 points. The MGI was stacking to the downside at this point. We couldn't auction above the open and we had a considerable gap to the downside. 

I like to watch for a break of B period when its an inside bar. C broke B's high, the IBH, and closed the gap leaving a weak high at Monday's low `5210.25` which was the first level on our price map. Weak highs are very visual levels so we should expect those to be taken. At this point the MGI is indicating we should get more upside. 

D period pulled back to the IBH and Open and found buyers ahead of C's halfback. We then put in our first set of singles in D period. We put in 3 more sets of singles in the day that all remain unfilled. We briefly paused at `5225` which was also on our price map before continuing higher. `5225` also served as our afternoon pulback and the low of the upper distribution. 

We eventually balanced below Monday's HOD and our Supply Zone `5240-46` for 5 periods before putting in an exploratory price spike and moving value up to this upper distribution. The price spike fell 10 ticks shy of all-time highs and ended the day closing inside the spike and above Monday's HOD. 

**Key Points**

- Monday's and Tuesday's gaps were filled.  
- 4 sets of unfilled singles.  
- Closed 10 ticks from all-time highs.  

I am surprised that we put in so many singles on the eve of FOMC even though the market clearly gave us indications that this would happen. I allowed my bias of historically seeing small ranges prior to FOMC to affect my ability to think in terms of probabilities.

Indexes are trading modestly lower ahead of tomorrows FOMC announcement. 

## Previous Day Review

After a strong move up late in the overnight session ES opened with a true gap of 23 points. We saw the `5222` level from the price map hold as support and the IBL. We rotated higher in A and B period. B period one timeframed up setting the IBH and RTH HOD at `5240.25`, a few ticks shy of the `5241` supply area also in the price map. 

After putting in the IBH (which was unbroken) we one timeframed down in C through F period before taking the IBL in G period. The market mostly balanced the rest of the session until the end of the day when M period put in an exploratory spike lower to 5210.25, the RTH LOD. 

**Key Points**

- Gapped up (held half gap)  
- Took the Overnight High  
- Higher Value  

As always it is important to recognize what we couldn't get done today. The bulls could not breach the `5240-5246` supply area falling short again today. We also couldn't close the gap although we did trade to half gap, leaving a price probe in M period. 

To summarize, the plan this morning provided plenty of context and good areas to watch the auction in order to be aware of what the market might do today. In this mornings note I spoke about how tricky gap days like today can be when we gap higher, build higher value, and also one timeframe lower most of the day.

## Overnight Review (_updated at 0900 CT_)

ES traded lower through the Asian session. Early in the Euro session we auctioned above the Asia HOD and pSettle. This quick move was met with sellers as the market sold off to new lows. We are currently building a double distribution inside Friday's range down 21 points in the Overnight.

>Volume: 240k  
>Range: 33 pts  
>Rotational Factor: -18  
>Delta: +3k  
>Positioning: 100% short  

## Mission Plan

We have obvious weakness in the overnight session as we gap down below the previous gap that was unfilled. When the market stops making sense I get more cautious. I will be looking for continuation of the move down but I will need to see market generated information clearly in favor of continuation down. 

I am aware that we have FOMC tomorrow so there will likely be less range than yesterday so the opportunies may be less as well. 

#### Open above 5183

I will look for support around `5183` which is an area of confluence. I do not expect much upside

`5183` is an area of confluence with Fridays (and the previous weekly) settle, Friday's TPOC, and structure. I will look for this to act as support. 
`5201` Friday's HOD. Above here I will look for the gap to fill and target previous LOD at `5210`. 
`5225` Previous POC becomes a target. 
`5240-46` is the supply area where we found sellers yesterday. 

#### Open Below or move below 5183

Again I don't expecte a huge move but we have areas to target and we could see strong selling/liquidation. 

`5167` Fridays LOD .
`5157` Is the balance low. This is my ultimate target for the downside. We could potentially see a move lower but the selling would need to be strong. At this level I would expect reversion back into the range.

# 2024-03-18

Last week was in inside bar but we maintain the higher timeframe uptrend for now. FOMC is this Wednesday. 

## Previous Day Review

On Friday ES behaved as expected with a rotation balance day that continued the daily one timeframing down from Thursday's session. Here is what the sellers accomplished in Friday's session.

- Gapped lower (true gap).  
- Moved value lower.  
- Acceptance of value lower with a wide TPOC of 11 TPOs slightly below the session halfback.
- Closed below the previous day's low.

Although we made good progress lower there are a couple of things that stand out to me from the session. We had a neutral day profile although the break higher was early in the session and quickly auctioned lower. We were not able to find price acceptance below the Initial Balance low and only left 3 ticks of excess suggesting that perhaps the market was too short or we found a price that buyers were willing to accept. Last but not least, the majority of the move happened in the overnight session. 

We also have to keep in mind that Friday was quad-witching and there were forces at play that will not be in the market come Monday. To summarize, we had a productive move lower with good volume setting us up for further continuation to the downside on Monday.  

>**Session Stats**  
>Volume: 1.4 mln contracts  
>Range: 34 pts  
>Rotational Factor: -1  
>Delta: -16k  

## Overnight Review (_updated at 0900 CT_)

The overnight session moved higher throughout the Asian session to find some resistance at Friday's HOD. Late in the Euro session we saw a squeeze higher that has us currently positioned around 20 points above Friday's range. 

>**Session Stats**  
>Volume: 150k (light)  
>Range: 44 pts (above average)  
>Rotational Factor: 24 (bullish)  
>Delta: +1000  
>Positioning: 100% Long

## Mission Plan

Large gaps can be tricky but my overall bias is to trade in the direction of the gap. My first focus though is to watch for an inventory correction/gap fill early in the session. 

We can have a day where we open higher, build value higher,  and still one timeframe down all day. I will take early attempts at breaking the 30-second Opening Range down. With inventory this long I believe the probabilities are in my favor. 

#### Open above 5201

The game plan here is to look for acceptance above Friday's range. If we fail at any attempts to move lower then I will look for more upside. Slow tempo, small pullbacks in the direction of the gap are worth monitioring for continuation. 

`5201` is Fridays HOD, 1σ↑ and stops the One Timeframing down. I am looking for buyers to step in at this level if we fill the gap.  
`Overnight High | Open` I'm not sure where this will be yet but I will be targeting these levels to take risk off when we get to them. 
`5222` This is the afternoon pullback high and value area high on 3/14 as well as 2σ↑.  
`5241-46` is a supply area with multiple days of excess. 

#### Acceptance back into Friday's range

`5190` is the afternoon pullback high. If we find buyers here I will still look for upside back to Friday's HOD at 5201.  
`5180-82` is TPOC | ONL | pSettle. 
`5167` is Friday's LOD. This isn't a poor low but there isn't much excess either. I will look for buyers/ short covering here at first. Multiple moves to this level will likely fail lower.
