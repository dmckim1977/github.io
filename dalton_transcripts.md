the week ahead it certainly has the potential to be different than any weeks we've seen recently Friday morning present us the strongest odds of being a correction in months and I'm referring to the excess high that you see on the graphic excess is one of the two most important Concepts we deal with additionally last week delivered two backtack non-- excess lows one on 35 and another on 36 when I see something like this it is usually an indication that is late lagered buying we used to have a saying where I lived as a as a kid we had a lot of hilly country and that was that the raag wagon runs fastest at the bottom of the hill meaning you know right as the market tops that could be the fastest move clear excess on Friday's high as I mentioned earlier it's the best excess we've had in months additionally Friday was an outside day to the downside to be an outside day the way we look at it the market must close below the previous day's low which it did on Friday now with all that enthusiasm of a potential correction getting underway the most important thing when we get excited about markets is learning how to monitor for continuation so the first thing for monitoring for continuation would be to see lower value on Monday within a short period of time we would then expect to see prices acceptance and range ex range extension back down below the 5100 level 5100 recently has proved to be the shortterm support level failure to establish acceptance below the 5100 level suggests that what we have seen is light liquidation rather than a more substantial combination of liquidation and new money selling so remember as we come into next week if there is anything to the correction we should see fairly early acceptance down below Friday's low followed by acceptance below the 5100 level have a great week

the week ahead over the years I have not been overly focused on technical discussions surrounding double tops and double bottoms however last Friday's future selling volume at the high stood out the market was only a few ticks from last year's High yet after multiple attempts the high held I thought maybe we'd get some liquidation uh with meaningful liquidation however there was no clarity as the downside follow through was very limited my early Focus this week will be to observe if there is to be downside follow through as the shorten week gets underway the coming week is light on news however retail sales are likely to be closely observed to see it deeper into the mind of the consumer additionally there are more earnings as earning season heats up if any break gets underway my focus shifts to the 4700 level which was the non-access low on the last fom CD have a great week
